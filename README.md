## Design Choices: 
This project is about holidays and vacations so i decided to use bright colours to make it more interactive and attractive for the users.


* Icons:
  I use the Bootstrap responsive navbar which in tablet and mobile devices turns the clasic 'burger-button' that everyone knows that is for navigation.
* Colours:
  
I like bright and vibrant colours because they have a higher influence, more potential and interactions. The dominant colours for this project are red and black which i related with the symbol of Albania flag(my personal choice).

  * Primary: #8d0801 ‚ÄúDark red‚Äù I choose this as the primary colour as the red color signals physical movement and gives us vitality. By the meaning of this colour i think will give the site good attraction.
  * Secondary: #bf0603 ‚ÄúStrong red‚Äù I chose this as the secondary colour as this color attracts the most attention.
  * Tertiary: #708d81 ‚ÄúPatina‚Äù This colour will be used for main heading and links because makes good contrast with the red,
  * Hover effect Colour: #f4d58d ‚ÄúManhattan‚Äù This colour provides excellent contrast for the hoover effect.

* Background:
The images I chose to use are actually pictures of cities in Albania they show different holiday destinations.
 I think using this pictures make the site more attractive and having more chances the users choose Albania their next holiday destination.

 Wireframes: 
I built the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq Wireframes. This time i decided to use picture on my wireframes so i could see how my site will look in different devices. You can see my wireframes  [Balsamiq Wireframes]()
