## Design Choices: 
This project is about holidays and vacations so i decided to use bright colours to make it more interactive and attractive for the users.


* Icons:
  I use the Bootstrap responsive navbar which in tablet and mobile devices turns the clasic 'burger-button' that everyone knows that is for navigation.
* Colours:
  
I like bright and vibrant colours because they have a higher influence, more potential and interactions. The dominant colours for this project are red and black which i related with the symbol of Albania flag(my personal choice).

  * Primary: #8d0801 ‚ÄúDark red‚Äù I choose this as the primary colour as the red color signals physical movement and gives us vitality. By the meaning of this colour i think will give the site good attraction.
  * Secondary: #bf0603 ‚ÄúStrong red‚Äù I chose this as the secondary colour as this color attracts the most attention.
  * Tertiary: #708d81 ‚ÄúPatina‚Äù This colour will be used for main heading and links because makes good contrast with the red,
  * Hover effect Colour: #f4d58d ‚ÄúManhattan‚Äù This colour provides excellent contrast for the hoover effect.

* Background:
The images I chose to use are actually pictures of cities in Albania they show different holiday destinations.
 I think using this pictures make the site more attractive and having more chances the users choose Albania their next holiday destination.

## Wireframes:
I built the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq Wireframes. This time i decided to use picture on my wireframes so i could see how my site will look in different devices. You can see my wireframes here [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sfg2x1c/pjpbifn)

 # Testing: 

 This was my first time using the Google Maps API, and Email.js so i was worried if i can make them work correctly, so i was all time testing myslef during work and when the project was finished, i was happy to see they work as i was expecting.

* Test Planning:
 With this project i had a clear idea how i will work and i will test my work , so far im happy with the implemented elements i choose as they work as i was planing.

* Testing Stories:
I had suggestion to not use flip cards as they was not working on mobile devices so i implemented lightbox with my images, and happy now with this choice as they are working perfect and passing the testing.

I ran into an issue with an annimation that i tryed, it was causing me lots of errors , so i deleted and code runs without issues.

Around half way through this project i decided to split the JavaScript code into different files as i finded difficult to run my code without issues.

* Overall:
  * Responsiveness -

Plan: I knew that i needed to make a responsive and mobile friendly website so i used Bootstrap because i find it easy and always responsive.
Implementation: Working on Html and using bootsrap classes makes it much easier and faster .
Result : The Responsiveness of the site works as expected.
Verdict : The site is responsive.

* Design -

Plan :For this project i choosed bright colours because i think they are more attractive , i included imagery as well. I picked a pallete by Coolors website.
Implementation : Is very fast and easy to implement ready pallete of colours as they save you to much time.
Result : The colours chosen are perfect for this site.
Verdict : This test has passed.

* Features:
Search-menu :

Plan: During planning i was thinking to implement a search menu which is interactive, in my case to link the users to different holiday locations.
Implementation : I created a column layout with Flexbox, ans is responsive as expected
Result :  This is also fully responsive.
Verdict : This test passed ,and working correctly.

* Form Validation :

Plan: During planning for this project i knew that i needed to include valid contact form. 
Implementation : I implemented 'Email.js' which i finded very good and working very well. Is easy to use it.
Result : This feature work as expected after testing.
Verdict : This test passed based on the expected behaviour.

Responsive navabar (mobile/tablet):

Plan : Is always important that the navigation meny to work in all devices.
Implementation : Using very simple jQuery, i imported the navbar from Bootstrap and is very effective.
Result : The burger-button nav works on a mobile/tablet device.
Verdict : This test passed based on the expected behaviour.

* Interactive Google Maps:

Plan : For this site is very important of using Google Maps. For me was first time working with Google maps API and i thought is going to be hard to make it work.
Implementation : I spend a lot of time testing this feature and i implemented interactive google maps from Google-developers, was easy to use it.
Result : A user can interact with the map and the information served, difference information is served based on the users interaction.
Verdict : This test passed based on the level of interaction a user can have with the Google map.

* Markup-validation-service:
  Testing steps : First think i wanted to make sure after i finished my website was to check that my website was effective.
   Implementation : I started by checking my website in the W3C Validation Service. I copy and pasted one by one the code of evey page that i have in my website and checked through W3C Validation Service.
    First step : opened Gitpod, clicked index.html and then i copied the code and went to W3C official and clicked over direct input validator.
   Result : my code passed without mistakes.
